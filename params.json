Tasks can be `synchronous`, `asynchronous` or both at the same time.\r\n\r\n### Analyzers\r\n\r\nIf a job fails, analyzers will analyze the error(hah!) and determine what do to with it.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Carthage\r\n\r\n[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.\r\n\r\nYou can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ brew update\r\n$ brew install carthage\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo integrate DogTail into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:\r\n\r\n```ogdl\r\ngithub \"bithavoc/DogTail\" ~> 0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `DogTail.framework` into your Xcode project.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nDogTail is released under the MIT license.
